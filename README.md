This project investigates the price trend of bitcoin. The yfinance api for yahoo was used to obtain data of bitcoin. Data obtained from yfinance could be as much as the data availabe
about that commodity. I wrote this model on the 18th of January, 2023. If you are checking this repo at a later date, don't worry, the notebook will give you data from your 
present date to the timedelta difference specified in my code.

I used the lstm(Long-short-term-memory) and AutoTS to train the data. I love to use lstm than autoTs, this is just a personal preference. It would be great if you could 
use other methods too. 

Goodluck!
